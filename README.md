# Case-Study-in-Epidemiological-Modelling-Forecasting-and-Policy-Making
A MATLAB/Python University project modelling an infectious outbreak and several potential interventions, with a view to guide policy.

EpiAssess4WriteUp.pdf contains the response to the task set in the worksheet. Posterior.mat is the initial posterior used for some of teh parameters. ODE_model.m is an ODE model of the system, my_nbin is a function to easily create arrays in a given probability distribution. Run_CEA_ODE.m generates the required analysis and figures. This includes modelling the disease and the outcome after several interventions as proposed in the Worksheet, assessing these interventions usiny DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Years) discounting.
